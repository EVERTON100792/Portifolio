## Overview

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a traditional client-side architecture with three main components:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Static HTML Structure**: Single-page application with semantic HTML5 sections
- **CSS-only Styling**: Modern CSS with custom properties (CSS variables) for theming
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Pure JavaScript for interactions and animations without framework dependencies
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive design starting from mobile breakpoints and scaling up

### Key Design Decisions
- **No Framework Approach**: Chosen for simplicity, faster loading times, and to showcase pure web development skills
- **Performance Optimization**: Uses Intersection Observer API to trigger animations only when elements are visible
- **Modern CSS Features**: Leverages CSS Grid, Flexbox, and custom properties for maintainable styling

### 5. Floating WhatsApp Button
- **Fixed Positioning**: Always visible in bottom-right corner
- **Pulse Animation**: Continuous attention-grabbing animation
- **Direct Integration**: Pre-configured WhatsApp message for client inquiries

## Data Flow

The application follows a simple client-side data flow:

1. **Page Load**: HTML structure loads with basic CSS styling
2. **JavaScript Initialization**: 
   - Particles.js configuration loads
   - Intersection Observer sets up animation triggers
   - Event listeners for interactions
3. **User Interactions**:

   - Hover effects on project cards
   - Click events for navigation and WhatsApp integration
